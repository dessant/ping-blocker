## Description

Ping Blocker is a browser extension that prevents sites from tracking
the links you visit through
[hyperlink auditing](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#hyperlink-auditing).

The extension blocks ping requests sent in the background when you click on links.
Beacon requests and CSP reports are also blocked.

Verify if ping requests are currently sent by your browser
with [Ping Spotter](https://armin.dev/apps/ping-spotter/).
